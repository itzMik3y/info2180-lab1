 <p>Ever since I first used the internet, I've been fascinated by websites and how they work. It's like there's a whole other world online, and every website is a door to a different place. As I started my computer science journey, I discovered web development, which is basically the art of building these digital doors. What's really cool is that with web development, I can combine both my creativity and technical skills. I get to decide how a website looks and feels, kind of like painting a picture, but also make sure it functions properly. Plus, it's amazing to think that something I create can be accessed by anyone around the world. It's like leaving my mark in the digital world, and that's why I'm so drawn to web development! </p>
